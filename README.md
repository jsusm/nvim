**I build this config using kickstart.nvim**

This config uses a bunch of [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugins, check them out!

I created this config keeping in mind the following features

- [x] Lsp
- [x] Snippets
- [x] Fuzzy finder
- [x] Good colorscheme
- [x] Debugger support (althoug i don't use it too much)
- [x] Sessions
